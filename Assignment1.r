#no non zero vectors found

# Split the training data into a training and validation set.

# Create the model on the training set

# Predict variable 'classe' with the test data supplied

## cross validation is used with the validation set which was split from the training data.




### Creating predictions using PCA
preProc <- preProcess(training_set[,-47], method="pca") # preProcess the training set with PCA
trainPC <- predict(preProc, training_set[,-47]) # new PCA results are created by using the predict function with the same training set
modFit_PCA <- train(training_set$classe ~ . ,method="rf", data=trainPC) # train a model with the new PCA results

## testing prediction on validation set we know the answers to
testPC<-predict(preProc,validation_set[-47]) # the validation set will need to be converted with the same PCA results as the training set
confusionMatrix(validation_set$classe,predict(modFit_PCA,testPC)) # Look at the results to see how close the model matched the correct value

## Final prediction on test set proviced
testPC_final<-predict(preProc,testing[-47])
predict(modFit_PCA,testPC_final)
